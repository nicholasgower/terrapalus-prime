# To Do List - Terrapalus

## Tech Tree

### UV Turret
- found a few options for tech upgrades in the form of AoE turrets (one variant shoots the ground and affects multiple targets, the other shoots multiple lasers from one turret) - can players research a few upgrades and get better turrets? everyone loves that
- Finalise the flee code so that they only flee after being hit by the turret
- 


### Inhibitor lamp


### Ultravium
- This liquid needs to be made useful; currently you can just collect it. Perhaps it can be formed into UV Grenades (rebaged grenades) and also UV Pucks (rebadged carbon) that can be fired out of a laser gun to stun enemies - kind of like a grenade launcher perhaps.
- Is it possible to also make an Ultravium Liquid Turret like the flamethrower turret


## Music
- Fix the music, it cuts in and out, and there's no interlude tracks, and the tracks don't really fit the theme of the planet.
- We can refer to the space age planets music

## Planet icon


## Cargo pods - read the latest FFF
Could be useful info in there
